    Big O Notation - 0(n)
-An algorithm is a precise set of step-by-step instructions designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task.
-Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour
of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
-We use big o to describe the performance of an algorithm.
This helps us determine if an algorithm is scalable or not.
That is, is this algorithm going to scale well if the input grows really large.
Example 1 -  Big o of 1 - O(1)
printing the first element in an array
No matter the number of elements in an array(size of our input), to print the first item in an array, the time to execute the method is always constant
The run time complexity of printing the first element in an array is Big O of one, meaning it runs at constant time.
When talking about run time complexity, we just want to know how much of our algorithm slows down as the input grows.

Example 2 - Big O of n - O(n)
Looping through an array anf printing the elements of the array
-if we have a single item in an array, we will have one print operation
-if we have a million items, we will have a million print operations
Therefore the time complexity of this operation is denoted with the Big o of n - O(n)
Meaning the cost of this operation(time) increases linearly with the size of the input.

Example 3 - Big O of n square - O(n * n)
